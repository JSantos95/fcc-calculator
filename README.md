# React Calculator

This is a Javascript Calculator I made using Reactjs and Redux. I followed the guidelines from freecodecode, found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

## Getting Started

### Prerequistes 

NodeJS ver. >=8.10

### Installing

I made this with create-react-app, you can find how to use it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

I used the redux and react-redux packages, all on the package.json

You can copy in the src files and public/index.html and this will work or click the [link](https://zen-booth-c36d01.netlify.app) to see the live version
